Python Logic Building Tasks
 Overview

This repository contains basic Python logic-building exercises completed as part of the February 2026 Data Science Internship.
The focus of this assignment is to strengthen core programming concepts such as conditions, loops, lists, strings, and basic data analysis using real-world inspired problems.

Tasks Covered
1️ User Login Check

Simulates a basic authentication system.

Compares stored credentials with entered values.

Demonstrates nested if-else conditions.

Concepts used:
if-else, string comparison, logical flow

2️ Pass / Fail Analyzer

Analyzes student marks.

Counts how many students passed and failed based on a threshold.

Useful in academic evaluation systems.

Concepts used:
Lists, loops, conditions, counters

3️ Simple Data Cleaner

Cleans and standardizes user names.

Removes extra spaces and converts text to lowercase.

Common preprocessing step in data analysis.

Concepts used:
String methods (strip(), lower()), lists, loops

4️ Message Length Analyzer

Calculates the length of each message.

Flags messages longer than a defined limit.

Applicable in text validation and filtering systems.

Concepts used:
len(), loops, conditional checks

5️ Error Message Detector

Counts the number of error logs from a system log list.

Helps in monitoring and debugging systems.

Concepts used:
Lists, built-in functions (count())
